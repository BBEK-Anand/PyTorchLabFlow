**PyTorchLabFlow** is a lightweight, offline-first framework designed to bring structure and sanity to your deep learning experiments. It automates project setup, manages configurations, and tracks results, all while keeping your data completely private and secure on your local machine.


### ü§î The Problem: Experiment Chaos

If you've worked on any deep learning project, this probably sounds familiar:

* üìÇ **Messy Directories**: A chaotic mix of notebooks, scripts, model weights, and config files with names like `model_final_v2_best.pth`.
* ‚ùì **Lost Configurations**: Forgetting which hyperparameters, dataset version, or code commit produced your best results.
* üìä **Difficult Comparisons**: Struggling to isolate the impact of a single change (e.g., a different learning rate) when comparing dozens of similar experiment runs that share the same model or dataset.
* üíª **Portability Nightmare**: Moving your project from a laptop to a powerful cloud server requires tedious and error-prone reconfiguration.
* üîí **Privacy Concerns**: Using online experiment trackers means sending potentially sensitive code and data to third-party servers.
* üåê **Internet Dependency**: Many popular tools require a constant internet connection, hindering productivity in offline environments.


## ‚ú® The Solution: PyTorchLabFlow

PyTorchLabFlow tackles this chaos with a simple, research-first philosophy.

* **Structure by Default**: It enforces a clean, standardized project structure, so you always know where to find your models, datasets, configs, and results.
* **Reproducibility Built-In**: Every experiment is automatically saved with its unique configuration, weights, and performance history, making any result perfectly reproducible.
* **Effortless Portability**: The `transfer` feature lets you package an entire experiment and move it to another machine with a single command. Go from local prototyping to large-scale training without friction.
* **100% Offline & Private**: Your work stays on your machine. Always. No data is ever sent to the cloud, ensuring complete privacy and security.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes.

### 1. Installation
```bash
pip install PyTorchLabFlow
```

### 2\. Workflow

Atypical Workflow where  you can  do  all  your  experiemnts/trails differ by  different Component and/or parameters is some fixed number of dedicated Jupiter files. No headech of finding trials that share  same  code-block( here it is Componet) and  analysing their performance,  just use  functions,  PipeLine manages all these  things ,  just focus  on analysis and dicision making. refer [Workflow in documentation](https://pytorchlabflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/workflow.html) for more details.
